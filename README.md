Dear connections,
I'm excited to share my latest project in Power BI a Food Nutrition Dashboard that brings data-driven insights into dietary habits and nutrition.

Steps taken:
1: Import data from excel to Power BI
*Remove unwanted columns
*Recheck if their is any missing values or blank space.

2: Data processing and DAX measures
*Total food items

3:Creating dashborad
*Inserting card for Total food items
*Created charts which shows the following
-sum of caloric value by food
-sum of cholesterol by food
-%GT sum of fat by food
-sum of protein and calcium by food and iron
-sum of sugar by food

4:Conclusion
*cheese spread has the higher caloric value of 27.36%
*cheese spread has teh higher cholesterol of 216 and apricot jam, apple butter has lowest cholesterol value of 0
*cheese spread has the highest fat value of 45.96%
*big mc donalds has highest iron and protein value of 4.4 and 25.90
*big mc donalds has highest sugar value of 18%.

With this dashboard we can analyse that food item cheese spread contains more cholesterol, fat and calories. Our body needs calories for energy, but eating too many calories and not burning enough of them off through activities can lead to weight gain.
